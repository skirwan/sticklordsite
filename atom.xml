        <![CDATA[<p>A special message from StickLord mastermind Hoggle:</p>

<p><i>This is a short I did entirely in the free animation application <a href="http://www.les-stooges.org/pascal/pencil/index.php">Pencil</a> with compositing done in <a href="http://www.apple.com/shake/">Shake</a>. It is basically having fun with the anime genre with a huge nod to <i>Inuyasha</i>. The characters are players in the MMORPG <a href="http://clanlord.com">Clan Lord</a> (Check out the <a href="http://www.deltatao.com/clanlord/demo.html">free demo</a>!)</p>

<p>This is me pushing Pencil as far as my skills are currently able to. If you are interested in animation be sure to <a href="http://www.les-stooges.org/pascal/pencil/index.php">check it out</a>. I want to give a HUGE thanks to Rina-chan for her voicework. Rina-chan and other excellent voice actor/actresses can be found at <a href="http://voiceacting.proboards62.com/index.cgi">the Voice Acting Club</a> &mdash; I highly recommend them as a great resource for your animation voicing needs. Also, a final thanks to Skirwan for his awesome webpagery and little ideas (such as Bi-ru!) that seem to find their way into several of my animations.</i></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>This landmark episode introduced T'rool Ambassador Gaak, found one of the most popular StickLord characters ever in an informal poll of the person writing this summary.  Fans have called him StickLord's Boba Fett, alluding to a character in the cult-classic StickLord parody 'Star Wars' that went on to be far more popular than the primary protagonists.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: The only characters to appear in every SNN broadcast are Phroon and R2D2.</p>

<p>If you didn't notice Phroon in the Planar Warming PSA, that's because you're blind.  Your mother and I have been discussing how to break the news to you.  She wanted to print it on a slip of paper and hide it in a fortune cookie the next time we had Chinese, but I pointed out to her that that was a somewhat insensitive way of telling you and besides you wouldn't be able to read it because you're frakking <i>blind</i>.  So now you know.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Throughout the mid-540s the StickLord News Network produced a series of public-service announcements under the tag line 'The More You Zo' featuring Zo celebrities from its various properties.  Though that timeline has since been extensively altered following a severe temporal incident involving a stuffed tiger and an un-pressed button, this example was preserved by a kindly higher-dimensional sentient shade of the color blue.</p>

<p>Planar warming was a severe issue in Puddleby in the timeline during which this piece was produced, leading in fact to the eventual destruction of that plane and, indirectly through various means, to the financial crisis plaguing Puddleby in this continuity  (see also: 'Alliance Castle Bailout').</p>]]>
